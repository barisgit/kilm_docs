title: Custom Descriptions & Metadata
description: Adding detailed descriptions and metadata to your libraries.

> **Note:** This guide is primarily aimed at **Creators** â€“ those setting up and managing the shared KiCad libraries.

While KiLM manages adding libraries to KiCad, KiCad itself displays a description for each library in its managers.

KiLM allows you to define these descriptions centrally within your library repository by looking for a specific YAML file.

## `library_descriptions.yaml`

If you place a file named `library_descriptions.yaml` in the root of a library directory that you have initialized with `kilm init`, KiLM will read this file when running `kilm setup`.

The expected format for this file is:

```yaml
# Symbol library descriptions
symbols:
  LogicalLibraryName1: "This is the description for Symbol Library 1 that will appear in KiCad."
  AnotherSymbolLib: "Contains specialized analog components."

# Footprint library descriptions
footprints:
  LogicalLibraryName1: "Description for Footprint Library 1 (can be different from symbol desc)."
  MyCustomFootprints: "Footprints for custom breakout boards."
```

**Key Points:**

- **Keys are Logical Names:** The keys under `symbols` and `footprints` (`LogicalLibraryName1`, `AnotherSymbolLib`, etc.) must match the actual *logical* names of the libraries within your KiCad library directory (usually the filenames without the `.kicad_sym` or `.pretty` extension).
- **Matching:** KiLM uses these logical names to find the corresponding library entry in KiCad's `sym-lib-table` or `fp-lib-table` and sets the description field.
- **Location:** The `library_descriptions.yaml` file must be in the root of the library directory managed by `kilm init`.
- **Setup Required:** These descriptions are applied only when you run `kilm setup`.

This provides a way to keep your library descriptions version-controlled alongside your library files.

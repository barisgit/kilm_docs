> **Note:** This guide primarily describes features beneficial for **Consumers** â€“ those using libraries managed by a Creator. The setup of the hook itself might be done by a Creator or an advanced Consumer.

KiLM provides a helper command [`kilm add-hook`](/reference/cli/add-hook/) to easily create a basic `post-merge` Git hook that runs `kilm update`.

## Using `kilm add-hook` (Recommended)

Navigate to the root of your Git repository containing your KiCad libraries and run:

```bash
kilm add-hook
```

This creates a `.git/hooks/post-merge` script that automatically executes `kilm update` every time you successfully run `git pull` or `git merge` in that repository.

## Manual Hook Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup or want to customize the hook script further, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Create Hook Directory (if needed):**
    Make sure the hooks directory exists in your repository:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .git/hooks
    ```

2.  **Create Hook Script:**
    Create a file named `.git/hooks/post-merge`.

3.  **Add Script Content:**
    Add the commands you want to run. 

    *Example 1: Only update libraries (similar to `kilm add-hook`)*
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Updating KiCad libraries via KiLM..."
    kilm update
    echo "KiLM update hook finished."
    ```

    *Example 2: Update libraries and run `kilm setup` (use with caution)*
    This will attempt to reconfigure KiCad after every pull, which might be desirable but could also have unintended consequences if the pull introduces breaking changes or removes libraries unexpectedly.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Updating KiCad libraries and running setup via KiLM..."
    kilm update
    # Add this line to also run setup:
    kilm setup
    echo "KiLM update and setup hook finished."
    ```

    *Note: You can also manually run `git pull` in library directories and `kilm setup` in your terminal.*

4.  **Make Executable:**
    Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
    ```

Now, after a `git pull` or `git merge`, the commands in your `post-merge` script will execute automatically.
